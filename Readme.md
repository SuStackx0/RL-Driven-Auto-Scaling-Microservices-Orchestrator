```* Define auto-scaling problem (metrics → scale actions).
* Build a simple traffic + service simulator.
* Create RL environment (obs, actions, rewards).
* Train tiny PPO/A2C agent on CPU.
* Compare with rule-based baseline.
* Export trained policy.
* Wrap policy in a small API controller.
* Run local load simulations against controller.
* Evaluate cost, latency, scaling stability.
* Document results + future improvements.
